# Project Starter Kit


For this assignment, depending on your set-up, you may want to run your code directly from the terminal
(by typing `python my_script.py` or `python3 my_script.py`) -- this will make it easier to move your
terminal around and see the images from the Pygame window.

To start, you may want to run `test_basics.py` to make sure your machine has installed needed packages.

`python test_basics.py`

or 

`python3 test_basics.py`

If you can't run this, try to debug the error message and/or see an instructor.

Then, take a look at cmpt120image.py, draw.py, and main.py. 
You'll use all these files to complete the assignment.
See Canvas for full details.
